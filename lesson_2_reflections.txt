Lesson 2 Reflections

7. Why create your own git repository? ... Well, you need it to add your own files that 
you want to track, as part of your own (separate) project.

8. staging area vs working directory vs repository... I see need for staging area. It is
where you hold the files from your working directory before you decide to commit. Commit
puts the files currently in the staging area into the repository, and now you can see
the history. What I am not sure is where the staging area is and where the repository is
(physically). Is that a mystery?
