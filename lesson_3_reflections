When would you want to create a repository that is remote rather than local?
When you want to share your files with others in your team who are working on their
own (networked) computers, of course.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
 stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
So that the sync'ing of my local files with the remote files is under my control. I
do it when I think it 'makes sense' - when there is a logical change that I need to
convey to my team. And vice versa.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would 
you use one instead of another?
Branch - a branching off from a certain commit, followed by a series of commits
by one person in one branch and another person in another (for example). Useful
when two people want to experiment with the files in their own way.
Clone - create a copy of a set of files (repository) in another directory.
Useful when you want to upload to a remote server, give a copy to another
person, etc.
Fork - clone on remote machine.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the 
remote stored locally?
You can have it if you are going to be offline for a while, and you
want to work offline knowing what the remote is ... perhaps you need
to diff your local with the remote and take appropriate steps afterwards.
