When would you want to create a repository that is remote rather than local?
When you want to share your files with others in your team who are working on their
own (networked) computers, of course.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
 stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
So that the sync'ing of my local files with the remote files is under my control. I
do it when I think it 'makes sense' - when there is a logical change that I need to
convey to my team. And vice versa.
