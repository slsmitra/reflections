Lesson 1 Reflections

1. Diff (FC) helped locate the misspelled word more easily. In a relative sense -- a lot of 
diff output would continue to make it hard to locate.

2. Having old versions around ... can go back to the version you know worked if you know
where it is.

3. Git allows commits to consist of multiple file updates each ... git is geared towards
programmers who usually work with multiple files on a project, and not others who might
very well just live with one file.

4. git log gives you the history with ids and messages. You can then use the
ids to compare the differences between files in (adjacent only?) commits

5. Version control helps with changes ... since I know I can go back to some changes I
am ok with making them ... basically, the 'Undo' feature is great.

6. Use Git for ... version control of code, of course.
